Hi! My name is Jay. I've been coding since 1995. 

I hang out on IRC all the time. I like helping people. But I've very busy. Mostly
with computer stuff. :)   If you want my help, here's how to get it. 

Firstly, **do not paste into IRC**. Use a code sharing service like [no paste](http://paste.scsys.co.uk) or [gist](http://gist.github.com).

No paste **all three** of these things **every time**:

(1) Your current source code. e.g.:

```
use 5.12.1;
say "Hello, world!";
```

(2) You running your program, all output, and the next prompt. e.g.:

```
$ perl myprog.pl
Hello, world!
$
```

(3) Your current question. **ONE** question. What were you expecting? What did you get instead?

By fully framing the question you've got a good chance of realizing the answer yourself. 
If not, you've greatly helped me (or anyone else!) help you. 

Thanks! See you online! :)
