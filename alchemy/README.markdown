* [Alchemy](http://zed.0xff.me/alchemy) is a fun game where elements combine to make 380 other things.
* I used [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) to draw [a graph](/downloads/jhannah/sandbox/alchemy.png) (6MB .png) of all combinations.
* Patches to the [source code](https://github.com/jhannah/sandbox/tree/master/alchemy) are welcome!  :)
