* [Alchemy](http://zed.0xff.me/alchemy) is a fun game where elements combine into other things.
* I used [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) to draw a graph of how all the elements combine.
* [Resulting graph](/downloads/jhannah/sandbox/alchemy.png) (6MB)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jhannah/sandbox/tree/master/alchemy). Patches welcome!  :)
